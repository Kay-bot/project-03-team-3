# Executive Summary

The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) has significantly transformed disability support in Australia, aiming to empower individuals with disabilities and elevate their quality of life. Integrating smart contracts within the NDIS offers an opportunity to simplify processes, enhance transparency, and ensure efficient resource allocation. Smart contracts, being self-executing agreements with terms encoded, provide a secure and automated approach to managing various NDIS aspects, potentially automating fund distribution and service execution, reducing administrative burden, and ensuring transparent fund usage. This integration aligns with the NDIS's goal of delivering effective, transparent, and participant-focused disability support services, demonstrating a commitment to leveraging fintech innovations to enhance financial management and service delivery within the disability support sector.

## Proof of Concept - Basic Framework & Methodologies

### Smart Contract Deployment
